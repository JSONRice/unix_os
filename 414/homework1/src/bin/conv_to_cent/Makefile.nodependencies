# Description:
#   This is a node (leaf) level Makefile and acts upon the contents
# encapsulated within the current working directory. This Makefile is
# responsible for compiling and linking in necessary libraries in order
# to generate a conv_to_cent executable that is then place within the
# 414/homework1/bin directory as 'conv_to_cent' This makefile contains
# no dependencies and is used during the clean target.
